              <h2>About LCC Learning Communities</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>The concept of "learning communities" at Lower Colmbia College began in the late 1980's under the direction of retired LCC philosophy instructor Jerry Zimmerman. Since then, the program has grown to include Integrated Studies and I-Trans courses taught by instructors representing many of LCC's academic programs.</p>
