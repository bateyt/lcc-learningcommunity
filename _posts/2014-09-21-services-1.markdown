  LCC Learning Communities allow students to earn credit for multiple courses through a themed curriculum. For the Winter 2016 Term, students participating in the Integrated Studies course Nutrional Pyschology earn a total of 10 credits---five credits each for NUTR&101 (Nutrition) and PSYC&100 (General Psychology).
